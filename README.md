# Secure Prompts 
# Securing your LLM integrated Applications with Secure Prompts


LLM’s provide application developers with the ability to augment and even replace large sections of their codebase with simple and intuitive prompts, which are natural-language queries that guides a model to produce a desired response. Instead of using numerous For loops, If blocks, and try-except statements, developers can harness LLM’s to produce a desired result simply by providing a level of context and a statement of the expected outcome, as you will see later in our example.

Replacing application logic code with prompts offers developers a simple and efficient way to harness the capabilities of an LLM to reduce coding effort and increase development velocity. 

As with most new technologies, new exploits are soon to follow and LLM’s are no exception. Prompt Hacking is a new security concern that is targeted to LLM integrated applications. Attackers attempt to intercept, replace or modify prompts from the application to produce misaligned or malformed responses from the LLM. The implications from such an attack are broad and can lead to execution of code, bypassing safety features and even data leakage. Securely managing and governing your prompts is a critical first step to reducing the security footprint of your LLM integrated applications. 

Unlike chatbot’s, applications leveraging LLM’s often do not require direct user input to the LLM. Storing prompts outside of the codebase also allows for greater flexibility and reusability of your applications. Let’s consider a web service that ingests json files from several different data sources, applies some basic transformations, and then stores the resulting output to a database. By integrating an LLM, the web service can simply ingest the json files and then use prompts to provide some basic context to the LLM and specify how the resulting data should be structured. The LLM manages the needed transformations and returns the expected results that can then be easily imported to the database. Now let's look at a scenario where our database structure changes, like a new field that we need to capture or a change to the schema. If we stored the prompts in the codebase, we would need to deploy a new revision of the entire web service. There is also the concern of unauthorized access to the prompt in the source repo or within a deployed service. Prompts are in an easy to read natural language format, which could provide an unwanted level of knowledge about source and destination data sources, such as database schema details. Storing your prompts in your codebase is similar to doing the same with your access tokens, certificates and passwords. This means you should apply the same level of control and governance to prompts as you would with other highly sensitive data.


# GCP Secret Manager

Fortunately developers can leverage existing services to ensure a high degree of security is applied to their LLM integrated applications. A vault or secrets management system such as GCP’s Secret Manager provides an ideal solution for application developers to use familiar tools to manage and control access to prompts for deployed services in the same way as their access keys and tokens. Secrets Manager can help ensure prompts are stored in a secure, immutable and encrypted environment only accessible to authorized services. Version control allows for easy updates and rollback for prompt configurations without the need to fully redeploy the application service. 


# Summary

Using GCP's Secret Manager to secure your LLM prompts offers several benefits:

Centralized Management: Secret Manager provides a centralized platform to store and manage all your LLM prompts securely. You can easily create, edit, and rotate secrets without the need to manually update your code or infrastructure.

Access Control: Secret Manager allows you to define granular access control policies for your prompts. You can specify which users or services have access to specific secrets, ensuring that only authorized entities can view or use your LLM prompts.

Encryption at Rest: Secret Manager encrypts all secrets at rest using industry-standard encryption algorithms, such as AES-256. This ensures that even if an attacker gains access to the underlying storage, they will not be able to decrypt your secrets without the proper encryption keys.

Versioning and Audit Logging: Secret Manager maintains a history of all changes made to your prompts, allowing you to easily revert to previous versions if necessary. Additionally, Secret Manager provides audit logs that track all access and modification activities, giving you a comprehensive view of who accessed your prompts and when.

Integration with Other GCP Services: Secret Manager integrates seamlessly with other GCP services, such as Cloud Functions, Cloud Run, and Kubernetes Engine. This allows you to easily inject prompts into your applications and services, without the need for complex manual configuration.

Compliance and Regulatory Support: Secret Manager can help you meet various compliance and regulatory requirements, such as HIPAA, PCI DSS, and GDPR. By centrally managing and securing your LLM prompts in Secret Manager, you can demonstrate your commitment to data protection and regulatory compliance.
